# Autonomous Reinforcement Learning Pursuer

## Overview  
This project implements **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Computer Vision (CV)**, and **Multi-Agent Systems** to develop an autonomous vehicle capable of pursuing and intercepting moving targets. The system combines **A* pathfinding**, **QMIX Multi-Agent RL**, and **real-time object detection** to create intelligent pursuit behaviors in dynamic environments.

### Key Features
- **Hybrid Pathfinding**: A* algorithms with BÃ©zier curve smoothing for natural movement
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: QMIX-based reinforcement learning for coordinated pursuit
- **Real-Time Detection**: YOLO-based target detection and tracking
- **JetBot Integration**: Designed for deployment on NVIDIA JetBot autonomous vehicles

## Why Reinforcement Learning?  
- **Adaptability & Generalization**: Learns from interactions, adapts to uncertain environments.  
- **Optimizes Long-Term Rewards**: Focuses on cumulative gains rather than immediate accuracy.  
- **Handles Complex Decision-Making**: Ideal for sequential tasks like autonomous navigation.  
- **Less Need for Labeled Data**: Learns through trial and error.  
- **Human-Level & Beyond Performance**: Proven effectiveness in AI-driven decision-making.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch, Gym, Ultralytics, FastAPI  
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA JetBot, Raspberry Pi, Cameras, Autonomous Vehicles  
- **Algorithms**: A* Pathfinding, QMIX, YOLO, Q-Learning, Double Q-Learning
