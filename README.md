# 🚗 Autonomous Reinforcement Learning Pursuer (WORK IN PROGRESS)

## 🧠 Overview  
This project implements **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques to develop an autonomous vehicle capable of pursuing and intercepting a moving target. Using **Q-Learning** and **Double Q-Learning**, the system learns optimal navigation and decision-making strategies in a dynamic environment.  

## 🔍 Why Reinforcement Learning?  
- **Adaptability & Generalization**: Learns from interactions, adapts to uncertain environments.  
- **Optimizes Long-Term Rewards**: Focuses on cumulative gains rather than immediate accuracy.  
- **Handles Complex Decision-Making**: Ideal for sequential tasks like autonomous navigation.  
- **Less Need for Labeled Data**: Learns through trial and error.  
- **Human-Level & Beyond Performance**: Proven effectiveness in AI-driven decision-making.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch, Gym  
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Cameras, Autonomous Vehicles  
- **Algorithms**: Q-Learning, Double Q-Learning  

## 🏆 Project Goals  
1. Implement a detection algorithm on a **Raspberry Pi-powered car**.  
2. Develop an RL-based navigation system for **single-agent** pursuit.  
3. Scale to **multi-agent** coordination for optimized interception.  
4. Integrate **object recognition** for real-time target identification.  

## 🚀 Progress & Milestones  
✅ Set up **GitHub repository** and **VS Code environment**  
✅ Debugged and compiled **sample RL projects**  
✅ Studied **prior autonomous vehicle projects** for reference  
🔲 Implement **single-agent RL navigation**  
🔲 Expand to **multi-agent coordination**
